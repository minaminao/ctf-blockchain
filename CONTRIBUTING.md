# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this repository. While this is primarily a personal collection of CTF blockchain challenges and writeups, contributions are welcome! However, please note that I might modify files added by you as I see fit.

## Contributions
- **New Challenges**: Adding new CTF challenges from various competitions
- **Solvers**: Adding new solutions or more efficient/interesting approaches to existing challenges
- **Writeups**: Adding detailed explanations, solution walkthroughs, or improving existing documentation
- **README Organization**: Improving categorization, descriptions, and fixing links

## Repository Structure
- Challenges are primarily organized by CTF in the [src/](src/) directory
- Each CTF has its own subdirectory (e.g., [src/ParadigmCTF2022/](src/ParadigmCTF2022/), [src/Ethernaut/](src/Ethernaut/))
- This repo use CI to check if challenges are solved through test files
- When solving CTFs, I use scripts, and contracts that are commonly used by both tests and scripts are extracted (e.g., `Exploit.sol`)
- Please refer to the [src/Templates/](src/Templates/) directory for examples of the expected structure
