# CTF Blockchain Challenges

This repository collects blockchain challenges in CTFs and wargames.

These challenges are categorized by topic, but they are not ordered by difficulty or by recommendation.

Some challenges come with my exploits (e.g., [Ethernaut](src/Ethernaut/), [Paradigm CTF 2021](src/ParadigmCTF2021/)).

If there are any incorrect descriptions, I would appreciate it if you could let me know via issue or PR.

## Ethereum

Note:
- If an attack is only valid for a particular version of Solidity and not for the latest version, the version is noted at the end of the heading.
- To avoid notation fluctuations, EVM terms are avoided as much as possible and Solidity terms are used.

### Ethereum/contract basics
- These challenges can be solved if you know the basic mechanics of Ethereum, [the basic language specification of Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/), and the basic operation of contracts.

### Misuse of `tx.origin`
- `tx.origin` refers to the address of the transaction publisher and should not be used as the address of the contract caller `msg.sender`.

| Challenge                                            | Note, Keywords |

| [Ethernaut: 4. Telephone](src/Ethernaut#4-telephone) |                |

### Pseudorandom numbers generated on-chain are predictable
- Since bytecodes of contracts are publicly available, it is easy to predict pseudorandom numbers whose generation is completed on-chain (using only states, not off-chain data).
- It is equivalent to having all the parameters of a pseudorandom number generator exposed.
- If you want to use random numbers that are unpredictable to anyone, use a decentralized oracle with a random number function. For example, [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/), which implements Verifiable Random Function (VRF).

### ERC-20 basics
- These challenges can be solved with an understanding of the [ERC-20 token standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20).

### Storage overwrite by `delegatecall`
- `delegatecall` is a potential source of vulnerability because the storage of the `delegatecall` caller contract can be overwritten by the called function.

| Challenge                                                      | Note, Keywords                                                                                    |

### Context mismatch in `delegatecall`
- Functions called in `delegatecall` are executed in the context of the `delegatecall` caller contract. 
- If the function does not carefully consider the context, a bug will be created.

| Challenge                                                 | Note, Keywords             |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| [EthernautDAO: 3. CarMarket](src/EthernautDAO/CarMarket/) | Non-use of `address(this)` |

### Integer overflow
- For example, subtracting `1` from the value of a variable of `uint` type when the value is `0` causes an arithmetic overflow.
- Arithmetic overflow has been detected and reverted state since Solidity v0.8.0.
- Contracts written in earlier versions can be checked by using [the SafeMath library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v3.4/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol).

| [Ethernaut: 5. Token](src/Ethernaut#5-token) | subtraction    |

### Ether transfers to a contract are not always executable
- Do not write a contract on the assumption that normal Ether transfer (`.send()` or `.transfer()`) can always be executed.
- If a destination is a contract and there is no receive Ether function or payable fallback function, Ether cannot be transferred.
- However, instead of the normal transfer functions, the `selfdestruct` described below can be used to force such a contract to transfer Ether.

| Challenge                                  | Note, Keywords |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| [Ethernaut: 9. King](src/Ethernaut#9-king) |                |

### Forced Ether transfer to a contract via `selfdestruct`
- If a contract does not have a receive Ether function and a payable fallback function, it is not guaranteed that Ether will not be received.
- When a contract executes `selfdestruct`, it can transfer its Ether to another contract or EOA, and this `selfdestruct` transfer can be forced even if the destination contract does not have the receive Ether function and the payable fallback function. 
- If the application is built on the assumption that the Ether is `0`, it could be a bug.

| Challenge                                    | Note, Keywords |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Capture The Ether: Retirement fund           |                |
| [Ethernaut: 7. Force](src/Ethernaut#7-force) |                |

### Not all procedures can be executed after a contract call
- A large amount of gas can be consumed by loops and recursion in `call`, and there may not be enough gas for the rest of the process.
- Until Solidity v0.8.0, zero division and `assert(false)` could consume a lot of gas.

| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| [Ethernaut: 20. Denial](src/Ethernaut#20-denial) |                |

### Forgetting to set `view`/`pure` to interface and abstract contract functions
- If you forget to set `view` or `pure` for a function and design your application under the assumption that the state will not change, it will be a bug.

| Challenge                                            | Note, Keywords |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| [Ethernaut: 11. Elevator](src/Ethernaut#11-elevator) |                |

### `view` functions do not always return the same value
- Since `view` functions can read state, they can be conditionally branched based on state and do not necessarily return the same value.

| Challenge                                    | Note, Keywords |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| [Ethernaut: 21. Shop](src/Ethernaut#21-shop) |                |

### Mistakes in setting `storage` and `memory`
- If `storage` and `memory` are not set properly, old values may be referenced, or overwriting may not occur, resulting in vulnerability.

| Challenge            | Note, Keywords                                                                                                  |

### Transaction tracing
- Various information can be obtained just by following the flow of transaction processing.
- Blockchain explorers such as Etherscan are useful.

| Challenge                                            | Note, Keywords                    |

| [Ethernaut: 17. Recovery](src/Ethernaut#17-recovery) | loss of deployed contract address |

### Reversing states (contracts must not contain confidential data)
- Since the state and the bytecodes of contracts are public, all variables, including private variables, are readable.
- Private variables are only guaranteed not to be directly readable by other contracts, but we, as an entity outside the blockchain, can read them.
- If there is private data in a transaction, it can also be solved by reading the transaction.

### Reversing EVM bytecode
- Reversing a contract for which code is not given in whole or in part.
- Use decompilers (e.g., [panoramix](https://github.com/eveem-org/panoramix), [ethervm.io](https://ethervm.io/decompile)) and disassemblers (e.g., [ethersplay](https://github.com/crytic/ethersplay)).

### Re-entrancy attack
- In case a function of contract `A` contains interaction with another contract `B` or Ether transfer to `B`, the control is temporarily transferred to `B`.
- Since `B` can call `A` in this control, it will be a bug if the design is based on the assumption that `A` is not called in the middle of the execution of that function.
- For example, when `B` executes the `withdraw` function to withdraw Ether deposited in `A`, the Ether transfer triggers a control shift to `B`, and during the `withdraw` function, `B` executes `A`'s `withdraw` function again. Even if the `withdraw` function is designed to prevent withdrawal of more than the limit if it is simply called twice, if the `withdraw` function is executed in the middle of the `withdraw` function, it may be designed to bypass the limit check.
- To prevent re-entrancy attacks, use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.

### Flash loan basics
- Flash loans are uncollateralised loans that allow the borrowing of an asset, as long as the borrowed assets are returned before the end of the transaction. The borrower can deal with the borrowed assets any way they want within the transaction.
- By making large asset moves, attacks can be made to snatch funds from DeFi applications or to gain large amounts of votes for participation in governance.
- A solution to attacks that use flash loans to corrupt oracle values is to use a decentralized oracle.

- If the algorithm distributes some kind of rights using the token balance at the time of a snapshot, and if a malicious user transaction can trigger a snapshot, a flash loan can be used to obtain a large amount of rights.
- A period of time to lock the token will avoid this attack.

### Sandwich attack
- For example, if there is a transaction by another party to sell token `A` and buy `B`, the attacker can put in a transaction to sell `A` and buy `B` before the transaction, and later put in a transaction to sell the same amount of `B` and buy `A`, thereby ultimately increasing the amount of `A` at a profit.
- In general, such "revenue earned by selecting, inserting, and reordering transactions contained in a block generated by a miner" is referred to as Miner Extractable Value (MEV). Recently, it is also called Maximal Extractable Value.

### Bypassing bot and taking an ERC-20 token owned by a wallet with a known private key
- If a wallet with a known private key has an ERC-20 token but no Ether, it is usually necessary to first send Ether to the wallet and then `transfer` the ERC-20 token to get the ERC-20 token.
- However, if a bot that immediately takes the Ether sent at this time is running, the Ether will be stolen when the Ether is simply sent.
- We can use Flashbots bundled transactions or just `permit` and `transferFrom` if the token is [EIP-2612 permit](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612) friendly.

### Constructor is just a function with a typo (< Solidity 0.5.0)
- In versions before v0.4.22, the constructor is defined as a function with the same name as the contract, so a typo of the constructor name could cause it to become just a function, resulting in a bug.
- Since v0.5.0, this specification is removed and the `constructor` keyword must be used.
